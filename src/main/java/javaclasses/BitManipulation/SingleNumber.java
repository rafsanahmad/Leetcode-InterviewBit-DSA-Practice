    //https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/description/
    /*Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one.
    Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,2,1]
Output: 1

Example 2:
Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1


Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4
-3 * 10^4 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 10^4
Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.
*/

    /*Here we are finding the XOR (Exclusive OR) of all the elements present in the given array.
    Since we have only 1 variable 'ans', space complexity will be O(1) and time complexity is also linear,
    since we are only iterating over the array and not applying any extra algorithm.
    Why XOR ?
    Since all elements are occurring twice except one element, the XOR of these element will be
    0 and as we know 0 xor N = N, we get our desired output.*/
