    //Leetcode 162
    /*A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given an integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index.
If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.
You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.*/

    public int findPeakElement(int[] nums) {
        int l = 0;
        int r = nums.length - 1;
        while (l < r) {
            int mid = (l + r) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1]) {
                r = mid;
            } else {
                l = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return l;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] ar = {1, 2, 1, 3, 5, 6, 4};
        System.out.println(new FindPeakElement().findPeakElement(ar));
