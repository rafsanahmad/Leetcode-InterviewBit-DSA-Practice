public class CourseSchedule {
    //https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/description/
    /*There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1.
    You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course
    bi first if you want to take course ai.

For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.
Return true if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return false.

Example 1:
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take.
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.

Example 2:
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take.
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1.
So it is impossible.*/
