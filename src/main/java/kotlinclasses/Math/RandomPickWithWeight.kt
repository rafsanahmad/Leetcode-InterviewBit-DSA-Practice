class RandomPickWithWeight {
    /*You are given a 0-indexed array of positive integers w where w[i] describes the weight of
    the ith index.

You need to implement the function pickIndex(), which randomly picks an index in the range
[0, w.length - 1] (inclusive) and returns it. The probability of picking an index
i is w[i] / sum(w).

For example, if w = [1, 3], the probability of picking index 0 is 1 / (1 + 3) = 0.25
(i.e., 25%), and the probability of picking index 1 is 3 / (1 + 3) = 0.75 (i.e., 75%).


Example 1:

Input
["Solution","pickIndex"]
[[[1]],[]]
Output
[null,0]

Explanation
Solution solution = new Solution([1]);
solution.pickIndex(); // return 0. The only option is to return 0 since there is only one element in w.
Example 2:

Input
["Solution","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex"]
[[[1,3]],[],[],[],[],[]]
Output
[null,1,1,1,1,0]

Explanation
Solution solution = new Solution([1, 3]);
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1. It is returning the second element (index = 1) that has a probability of 3/4.
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
solution.pickIndex(); // return 0. It is returning the first element (index = 0) that has a probability of 1/4.

Since this is a randomization problem, multiple answers are allowed.
All of the following outputs can be considered correct:
[null,1,1,1,1,0]
[null,1,1,1,1,1]
[null,1,1,1,0,0]
[null,1,1,1,0,1]
[null,1,0,1,0,0]
......
and so on.


Constraints:

1 <= w.length <= 10^4
1 <= w[i] <= 10^5
pickIndex will be called at most 10^4 times.*/

    /*
 Steps:
 1.Use cumulative weights as boundaries.
 2.Pick a random number in the total range.
 3.Use binary search to find which weight bucket it lands in.
 4.Bucket size = weight â‡’ higher weight = higher chance.

Use accumulated freq array to get idx.
w[] = {2,5,3,4} => prefixSum[] = {2,7,10,14}
then get random val random.nextInt(14)+1, idx is in range [1,14]

idx in [1,2] return 0
idx in [3,7] return 1
idx in [8,10] return 2
idx in [11,14] return 3*/
