    //https://leetcode.com/problems/count-complete-tree-nodes/description/
    /*Given the root of a complete binary tree, return the number of the nodes in the tree.

According to Wikipedia, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled in a complete
binary tree, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1
and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

Design an algorithm that runs in less than O(n) time complexity.

         1
       /   \
      2     3
    /  \     \
   4    5    6

Example 1:
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: 6

Example 2:
Input: root = []
Output: 0

Example 3:
Input: root = [1]
Output: 1


Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5 * 10^4].
0 <= Node.val <= 5 * 10^4
The tree is guaranteed to be complete.*/

    //Number of nodes in a perfect binary tree of height h = 2^h - 1
    /*total time complexity:
âœ… O((log n)^2)

Because:
At each recursive call, you spend O(log n) time (to compute depth),
And you do this for O(log n) levels at most.
